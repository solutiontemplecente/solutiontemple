            <p>We are committed to providing authentic, ethical, and powerful spiritual services. Our refund policy is designed to be fair while respecting the nature of the energetic work we perform.</p>
            
            <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-primary mt-6">Nature of Spell Casting</h2>
            <p>Spell casting is a spiritual service that involves time, energy, and the use of consecrated materials. The results of spell work are influenced by many factors, including the will of the individuals involved and the complexities of the situation. While we have a very high success rate and pour our full energy into every ritual, the universe's final decision is not something that can be guaranteed in the same way as a physical product.</p>

            <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-primary mt-6">Refund Eligibility</h2>
            <p>Due to the nature of spell casting and the resources committed once a ritual has begun, we have the following policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A full refund is available if you choose to cancel your service BEFORE your ritual has begun and materials have been prepared.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Once the ritual has commenced, no refunds can be issued.</strong> The energy, time, and materials have already been expended on your behalf.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We believe in the integrity and power of our work, and our commitment is to see you achieve a positive outcome. We will provide post-spell follow-up and support to help guide you. By booking a service with Solutiontemple, you are acknowledging and agreeing to this refund policy.</p>
